This is an implementation of a doubly circular linked list to iterate through a list in both directions to search for 
a series of inputs.

Example:
a b c d e f

input a c e
output a b c d e

input e c a
output e d c b a

input a e d
output a f e d

Used this code for a video game I play to predict the room rotations depending on which rooms are known.
